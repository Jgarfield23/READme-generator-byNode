# 09 Node.js: Professional README Generator

## Description

The purpose of this project is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. By dynamically generating a README, this allows the project creater to devote more time working on the project.


## Installation

1. Run node index.js in the intergrated terminal
2. Follow the prompts


## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```


## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
